ODDBALLZ, Your Wacky Computer Petz (tm)
by PF.Magic.

Welcome to Oddballz - Digital life at its wackiest!

Also available in the Computer Petz line from PF.Magic: Dogz and Catz! 
Dogz (tm) are the very first Petz to live on your computer, giving you the 
joys of owning a dog without needing a pooper scooper!  Dogz live on your 
desktop where they can scamper across applications, play games like keep away, 
fetch and chase, or nap in the corner of your screen while you're working.

Catz (tm) are the next in line of Your Computer Petz, following in the 
pawprints of Dogz.  Catz live on your desktop and they don't mind sharing it 
with you.  Your Catz enjoy being petted and groomed.  You can play with them 
and watch them stalk the Mouse across your documents.  In the screen saver mode, 
they also enjoy taking CatNapz.

Catz, Dogz and Oddballz can all be installed on your computer, but you can 
only have one active at a time.

The full versions of Oddballz, Catz and Dogz PC CD-ROM Windows 95/3.1 and Mac CD 
are available from your local software retailer RRP £14.99.  If you would like further 
details please contact Mindscape on 01444 246333.

ODDBALLZ QUICK START

Getting Started
  - After you install Oddballz, you'll see an "Oddballz" icon in a Windows 
    Program Group (or under the "Programs" item of the START menu in 
    Windows '95) named "Yourname's Oddballz" (where "yourname" is your 
    first name).
  - Start Oddballz by double-clicking on the icon named "Oddballz" (or simply 
    selecting the "Oddballz" item in the Start menu under Windows '95).
  - This will open the Oddballz Playpen.
  - Grab any of the seven Oddballz Eggz from the Oddballz Incubator, release 
    it onto your desktop to watch it hatch, and begin playing with your new Petz.

All seven Oddballz included in the retail collection have their
own distinct personalities and their own sets of tricks.  Try using the 
different toys with all of the Oddballz to find out what makes them tick...
or sing...or dance...or fly...or explode.
  
Oddballz like to show off, and the Screen Saver is your chance to let them.
It is also a great way to display all the pictures you've taken of your Oddballz!
Be sure to turn the lights out if you want to catch your Oddballz in a 
compromising position.

If you have the Starter Kit demo version, you will only have one character.  
a few of the toys, and limited features to play with - until you purchase 
the full retail version.


SOME TIPS TO GET STARTED...

Playing With Your Oddballz
  - Click on an Egg in the Incubator and drag an Oddballz out to the Playpen.
    When you let go of the Egg, the Oddballz will hatch and you can begin playing
    with your new Petz.

Petting and Tickling Your Oddballz
  - To pet or tickle your Petz, simply click and hold the left mouse button 
    while the cursor is anywhere over them.  
  - Move the cursor over your Oddballz while holding down the left mouse button.
  - If you tickle your Petz long enough and in the right spots, you might
    discover some surprising results.

Training Your Oddballz
  - Hold a Grubz in front of your Oddballz to get them to perform tricks.
  - Shake the Grubz to get your Oddballz to move on to the next trick, 
    or drop the treat immediately to reward your Petz for a trick you like. 
  - This teaches them to do it again.
  - Repeat this procedure until your Oddballz performs the appropriate trick 
    as soon as you pull out the Grubz. 
  - Be patient, Oddballz have a wide variety of tricks to show you. 

Picking up Your Oddballz
  - To pick up Oddballz and move them to a new location, click the right 
    mouse button while the cursor is anywhere over your Petz.
  - Don't worry - this won't hurt them. In fact, they enjoy it.  
    Releasing the mouse button will drop your Oddballz safely to the desktop.
  - To play with a different Petz, drop the current Oddballz into the 
    Funnel at the top of the Incubator and grab a new Egg 
    from the container.  Use the arrow buttons atop the Incubator to scroll 
    through and choose from your Oddballz collection.
  
IMPORTANT NOTE:
  - In Fullscreen mode, Oddballz love to roam wild on your computer screen.
  - Let your Oddballz loose on the screen by left-clicking on the Fullscreen
    /Playpen Toggle button, located in the top center of the Oddballz Toy 
    Module.  You will not be able to click on any other application until you...

	1)  Return Oddballz to Playpen mode, or
	2)  Quit Oddballz, or
	3)  Press ALT-TAB to switch to another application.


AUTOMATICALLY LAUNCHING ODDBALLZ AT STARTUP (Windows '95)
  - If you follow these steps, Oddballz will automatically launch every time 
    you start your computer:
        1)  Open the Oddballz directory so you can see the Oddballz program 
            icon (Oddballz.exe).
        2)  Click on the Oddballz program icon with the right mouse button, 
            and choose "Create Shortcut".
        3)  Leave this window open and visible on your desktop.
            In a separate window, open the following directory:  
            c:\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp.
	4)  Drag the shortcut of Oddballz from Step 2 into the StartUp window.
	5)  The next time you restart your machine, your Oddballz will be 
            there to greet you! 


COLLECTING ODDBALLZ

Oddballz to your collection simply by finding and downloading new Oddballz Eggz 
into your existing program.  

	TO ADD AN EGG TO YOUR COLLECTION
	Quit out of your Oddballz application if you haven’t already.
	Download or copy the Egg file onto your hard drive. 
	Double-click on the Oddballz Eggz Installer and follow the 
	instructions to install the Egg into your Oddballz application.  

Your new Egg will automatically appear in your Incubator the next time you run 
Oddballz.  You must be sure to Quit Oddballz before installing a new Egg.

Oddballz Eggz can be found in the following two ways:

	1)  Visit the PF.Magic Oddballz Web site at www.oddballz.com.
            Here you will find the latest tips and info. about your Oddballz 
            characters, including the newest downloadable Eggz for 
            you to install into your Oddballz application.  The site
            will also link you to other Oddballz Host sites featuring 
            different collectable characters.
	    
	    In addition to the latest Eggz, you will find a downloadable 
            Oddballz Starter Kit featuring one of the first seven characters 
            included in the retail version of Oddballz.  To add Eggz to 
            your Starter Kit, download and install as you would for the 
            retail version.  Remember, your Oddballz will have limited toys

KNOWN MISBEHAVIORS ("TROUBLESHOOTING")

"I’M HAVING TROUBLE PUTTING ODDBALLZ BACK INTO THEIR INCUBATOR."
  - Make sure your hand cursor is positioned over the Funnel when you drop the 
    Oddballz back into their Incubator. 
  
"MY ODDBALLZ DISAPPEAR FROM THE SCREEN."
  - Like a real pet, your Oddballz will sometimes be busy with their own agenda.
  - Try double-clicking the mouse to call your Oddballz back (it won't be long before 
    they're back on screen).
  - If your Oddballz completely refuses to come when it is called, try pressing the 
    ESC key; this adds extra emphasis to your plea, and your Oddballz should come 
    back on screen in no time.

 "MY ODDBALLZ SOMETIMES SLOW DOWN ON THE SCREEN."
  - Oddballz are mindful of other applications that may be running at the same time.  
    If an important application needs to control your computer for a few seconds, 
    your Oddballz will hold still until that application lets go.  It's nothing to 
    worry about!

"THE ODDBALLZ PLAYPEN WINDOW HAS CHANGED COLORS."
  - If you change your Display resolution or color palette while Oddballz is running, 
    your Oddballz colors may shift undesirably.  To fix this, simply quit and 
    relaunch Oddballz.
  - Also, when running on a system with only 256 colors, opening or selecting another 
    application can sometimes cause Oddballz colors to change (the programs are 
    competing for the same palette colors).  If your Oddballz turns black, changes 
    colors in an unexpected way, or the Playpen background colors become distorted, 
    try minimizing the Playpen window and re-opening it.
  - If this does not work, close and relaunch Oddballz and the problem should go away.

"THE ODDBALLZ SCREEN SAVER REQUIRES A PASSWORD, BUT I DID NOT SET ONE!"
  - If you had already set a password for another Screen Saver, you may find that this
    password is still required for Oddballz.

"I’M NOT HEARING ANY SOUNDS!"
  - To hear your Oddballz, you need a SoundBlaster(TM)-compatible sound card and 
    speakers installed.
  - Remember that if Oddballz is ever minimized or another application is opened on 
    top of Oddballz, your Oddballz will keep quiet.  Only when Oddballz is the 
    foreground application will sounds be heard.
  - If sounds disappear for any reason, you can always close Oddballz and then 
    relaunch it; sounds should return.

"THE POP BOX SONGS I ADDED DON'T PLAY ALL OF THE WAY THROUGH."
  - If you have added a .wav file to your Pop Box "Songs" folder, the Pop Box may 
    not be able to play the file all of the way through.  We suggest you keep the 
    length of your .wav files under 4 seconds for best results.

"MY ODDBALLZ EGGZ ARE NOT SHOWING UP IN THE INCUBATOR."
  - Before installing a new Egg, make sure you quit Oddballz.  Follow the instructions 
    in the "Collecting Oddballz" section.  Relaunch Oddballz.  If your Egg still does 
    not show up in the Incubator, you may have run into a copying or downloading 
    error, and you should try recopying or downloading a fresh file.
  - If you have renamed any of the Oddballz folders found in the "Eggz" folder located
    at the root directory of your Oddballz application, the program will not recognize 
    these new folder names and you will no longer have those Eggz (and Oddballz) 
    available to play with in the Incubator.  To make the Eggz available, simply 
    rename the folders back to their original breed-specific names.
  - If you have more than one copy of Oddballz installed on your computer, any 
    downloaded Eggz will automatically be added to the copy of Oddballz that was most 
    recently launched.  To copy an Egg to another copy of Oddballz, launch that copy 
    of Oddballz, Quit Oddballz, then reinstall the Egg.  An alternative to 
    reinstalling the Egg is simply copying the folder of the new Egg to the other copy
    of Oddballz.

"DOES INSTALLING ODDBALLZ AFFECT MY SYSTEM FILES?"
  - The files that come with PF.Magic Oddballz are as system-friendly as possible.  
    Oddballz does not affect or change your AUTOEXEC.BAT or CONFIG.SYS files.

"WINDOWS OR ODDBALLZ PUTS UP AN ERROR MESSAGE SAYING ‘FILE NOT FOUND’ OR ‘CANNOT LOAD’."
  - This is probably because the file really isn't there.  Verify that the file in 
    question exists.  If it is truly missing, reinstall Oddballz.
  - This could be the result of an error occurring during installation.  If you had an
    error during installation, try reinstalling Oddballz.
  - Often, Windows will display this message if you are low on memory.  Try quitting 
    applications and/or restarting your computer to free up memory.
  - If none of the above work, and the file is present, the missing file may in turn 
    require additional files to be loaded.  If the latter are not present, Windows 
    will complain about the former.  This situation is difficult to diagnose because 
    there's no indication as to what is the missing file.  Try reinstalling Oddballz.

"LOAD ERROR:  ODDBALLZ CANNOT RUN BECAUSE IT CANNOT LOAD OR FIND THE FILE ODDBALLZ.WAD."
  - This may occur if you install Oddballz, and before you ever launch Oddballz to
    play with it, you go into the Windows Settings and select the Oddballz Screen
    Saver, causing your computer to try to launch the Screen Saver. 
  - Launching Oddballz should prevent this from happening again.
